# AT Audio Player

Click [here](https://github.com/IsakTheHacker/AT-Audio-Player/releases/latest) to download the latest release!

***

Advanced Textbased Audio Player. This is a project which I started because I wanted a lightweight textbased application for music playback. The main reason why I prefer this instead of the more sophisticated GUI alternatives is that it is faster to use once you learned it.

AT Audio Player currently supports pause/unpause/stop functionality, playlists and some more basic features. If you want to contribute to make the project better, read the Contribution section.
